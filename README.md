ProgrammingChallenge
====================  
  
This is a simple HTML page that demonstrates the basics for showing a message on the screen. It challenges the user to change the code so that the message changes.

It also has a bonus task that asks them to change the color of the Boy Scouts logo at the top. Since the logo is drawn using SVG, this is easily accomplished using jQuery.
    
This also includes a Spanish and Korean version of the page.
    
This is being used during a recruitment drive to drive awareness of the Programming merit badge.
